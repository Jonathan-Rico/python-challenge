-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, 
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, 
-The average of those changes,the greatest increase and decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The pypoll script reads through a larger data set of voter data in the election_data.csv file.

The analysis summary contains:
